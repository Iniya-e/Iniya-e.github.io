        I am a curious and driven professional with a passion for innovation and continuous improvement. With experience in bioprocess automation, I thrive on solving real-world challenges, particularly in process design and quality assurance. Currently pursuing an MBA in Operations and Supply Chain, I aim to blend technical expertise with strategic insights to optimize efficiency and sustainability across supply chains.
        I excel in collaborative environments, connecting cross-functional teams, streamlining workflows, and ensuring timely, impactful outcomes. Outside work, my creative pursuits like Mandala Art and Macrame inspire fresh perspectives and balance, fueling my approach to challenges with mindfulness and creativity.
