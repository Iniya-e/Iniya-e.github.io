Iniya’s **active participation** and **insightful contributions** enriched the learning environment. Her diverse knowledge, both **professionally** and **personally**, enables her to view challenges from multiple perspectives, distinguishing her as an outstanding participant.

Notably, Iniya possesses **excellent communication skills**. She excels in **active listening** and articulates her thoughts concisely and with precision. Her ability to communicate effectively—being both **polite** and **assertive**—reflects her **professionalism** and **dedication**.
